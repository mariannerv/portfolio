            <h3>My college journey</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                Throughout my academic journey, I attended two colleges. I've always known I wanted to pursue something related to
                technology, but due to unforeseen circumstances, I initially enrolled in a <span><a href="https://www.iscal.ipl.pt">Management degree at ISCAL</a></span>. At first, I was
                content with it and even enjoyed certain aspects, but deep down, I knew it wasn't what I truly wanted to study. This
                realization became even clearer when I attended a beginner's JavaScript workshop and wrote my first lines of code.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I had a backup plan: if necessary, I would graduate with the Management degree and then pursue a Master's in a
                tech-related field. However, I didn't give up on my original goal. After two years of persistent effort, I successfully
                transferred to <span><a href="https://ciencias.ulisboa.pt/pt/a-faculdade">Faculdade de CiÃªncias da Universidade de Lisboa (FCUL)</a></span>, where I am now finishing my degree in <span>Information
                Technology.</span> (I graduate in January!)
            </p>
            <p>My degree also includes a minor, and I chose to pursue one in <span>Statistics and Operational Research</span>.</p>
            <br>

            <br><br><br>
            <h3>Future Goals</h3>
            <p>After graduation, I aim to pursue a career in software development, focusing on backend development or DevOps and eventually pursue a Master's degree or a Postgraduation course in Cybersecurity.
