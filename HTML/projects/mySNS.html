            <h3>Development date</h3>
            <p>January 2024 - June 2024</p>

            <h3>About the project</h3>
            <p>
            
            This project had us develop a secure distributed file storage system called mySNS, designed for managing medical files like exams and
            prescriptions. The system ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity using Java's security API and follows
            best practices in cryptographic protocols.
            <br><br>
            <b>Key features include:</b>
            <br><br>
            1. <span>File Encryption and Signing</span>: <b>Implementation of hybrid encryption</b> (AES for file encryption, RSA for key encryption) and
            digital signatures to protect files during transmission and storage.
            <br><br>
            2. <span>User Authentication and Access Control</span>: The system authenticates multiple users with hashed passwords (salted) and
            controls access to files, preventing unauthorized access.
            <br><br>
            3. <span>TLS-secured Communication</span>: Client-server interactions are protected using TLS to ensure secure data transmission.
            Advanced Server Security: I configured firewall rules and set up intrusion detection with Snort, ensuring robust server
            protection.
            <br><br>
            <b>This project involved tackling real-world security challenges such as handling adversarial threats, file encryption, and
            managing secure communications in a distributed environment.</b>
