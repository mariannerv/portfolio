            <h3>Development date</h3>
            <p>January 2024 - June 2024</p>
            <br>
            <h3>About the project</h3>
            <p>
                This was a group project where we developed a web application designed to <span>make it easier for
                    citizens to report various
                    issues</span>. These issues could range from potholes in the road to maintenance requests, and even
                suggestions for
                improvements. The goal was to <span>facilitate smoother communication between citizens and Lisbon's Town
                    Hall</span>, allowing for
                better responsiveness in addressing public concerns.
                <br><br>
                The app was divided into two roles: the <span>regular user</span> and the <span>Town Hall
                    employee</span>. Regular users could report new
                occurrences and track the status of issues marked as 'Open' or 'In Progress.' All registered users were
                also able to
                report new occurrences and provide feedback on any of the 'Solved' issues. Any regular user would also
                be able to connect via live chat to a town hall employee.
                <br><br>
                As for the town hall employees, they were able to manage all occurrences, check if there were any open
                chats and everything a regular user can do.
                <br><br>
                We were also tasked with implementing an <span>external web service</span> that other companies could
                use to filter and search for
                occurrences based on their specialty for extra points.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>My responsibilities</h3>
