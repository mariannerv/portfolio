            <h3>Development date</h3>
            <p>May 2024 - Present</p>
            <br>
            <h3>About the project</h3>
            <p>
                This one isn't exactly a project, it's more of a <span>colletion of scripts</span> that I've developed for other projects over time.
                My plan is to keep adding scripts to the repository.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Scripts in the colletion</h3>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li><span>Firewall rules to block known country IPs</span>: This script generates IPSets from a database of IP
                    addresses, allowing the creation of firewall rules to block traffic
                    from countries identified as high-risk for cyberattacks, based on data from Project Honey Pot and MaxMind's GeoLite2
                    database.</li>
                <li><span>Elasticity Script for Google Cloud VMs</span>: This script dynamically manages Google Cloud Compute Engine VM instances based on the average CPU usage of currently
                running instances whose names start with "servidor". When CPU usage exceeds certain thresholds, additional VMs are started. Conversely, when CPU usage drops below defined
                levels, instances are stopped to conserve resources.</li>
                <li><span>CPU Usage Monitoring for Google Cloud VM Instances</span> This Bash script monitors CPU usage across all running Google Cloud VM instances whose names contain the word
                servidor. It retrieves the CPU usage, calculates the average CPU usage across all matching instances, and logs the results.</li>
                <li><span>PostgreSQL Automatic Backup</span> This script provides a Dockerized solution for automating PostgreSQL database backups. The backup script runs inside a
                Docker container and creates compressed, encrypted backups, which are stored locally. The solution also manages backup
                retention, deleting old backups based on the specified number of days.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
