            <h3>Development date</h3>
            <p>February 2023 - May 2023</p>

            <h3>About the project</h3>
            <p>
            This project is a web service designed to help users find short vacation trips to European capitals with
            favorable weather conditions. Users can specify their departure city and maximum flight budget, and the system will
            return vacation options that meet these criteria. The system ensures only direct flights with at least two days of sunny
            weather and limits trips to four days. It is built using a <span>RESTful architecture</span>, with a backend powered by <span>Flask</span> and a
            <span>SQLite database</span>. The project integrates <span>external APIs</span> for weather forecasts and flight information to provide up-to-date
            and accurate trip suggestions.
            <br><br>
            Security and efficiency are also enhanced in a later phase, introducing <span>SSL/TLS</span> for secure communicatio and <span>Zookeeper</span> for
            managing client sessions.
