            <h3>About the project</h3>
            <p>
                This one isn't exactly a full project, it's just a collection of classical ciphers I developed for one of my classes.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Ciphers I coded</h3>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li><span>Caesar Cipher (Shift Cipher)</span>: TThis is one of the simplest and most well-known ciphers. In the Caesar cipher, each letter in the plaintext is shifted
                by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 5, "A" becomes "F", "B" becomes "G", and so
                on. Decrypting the message involves reversing the shift by the same amount. It's a substitution cipher where each letter
                is replaced by another letter a set distance away in the alphabet.</li>
                <li><span>Vigenère Cipher</span>: This cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher that uses a keyword to control the encryption. Each letter of the
                plaintext is shifted based on the corresponding letter in the repeating keyword. For example, if the keyword is "KEY",
                the first letter of the message is shifted according to "K", the second by "E", and the third by "Y", repeating as
                needed.</li>
                <li><span>Vigenère Cipher with Tabula Recta</span> A variation of the Vigenère cipher that uses a tabula recta, which is essentially a matrix of shifted alphabets. Each
                row in the table represents a Caesar cipher with a different shift. Encoding is done by selecting rows based on the
                keyword and columns based on the plaintext. </li>
                <li><span>Polybius Square Cipher</span> Tis a grid-based cipher that uses a 5x5 matrix of letters (combining "I" and "J" to fit). Each letter in the plaintext is
                replaced by its coordinates (row and column) in the grid. For example, "A" might become "11", "B" could be "12", and so
                on.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            </p>
