            <h3>About the project</h3>
            <p>
                This project was developed as our final degree project and is by far the biggest and most complex project I've worked
                on. The premise of the project was to <span>develop a Lost and Found System with an auction component</span>. Essentially, if a person found a lost object, they would take it to 
                a registered police station, where information about the object would be registered. This information would include a description, a picture, the location and time it was
                found, its brand, category, and other relevant details.
                <br><br>
                If someone lost an object, they could register it online, the same way one would register a found object. The person could then
                crosscheck their lost object with all the found objects in the system and if there was a match they and the police station would be notified.
                <br><br>
                During the first semester, from September 2023 to December 2023, we planned out the entire project. We <span>researched the technologies and
                tools we would use, decided on the methodology (SCRUM in this case), created a Gantt chart for our tasks, assigned
                everyone to specific areas of the project, and developed an RMMM plan</span>, which proved to be extremely useful.
                <br><br>
                In our second semester, from January 2024 to June 2024, we executed the plan as best as we could. There were plenty of
                challenges along the way: some people gave up, some struggled more than others, and all of us put in far more work than
                we anticipated. But in the end, it all worked out.
